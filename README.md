# Data Analysis on Electric Vehicle

## Project Overview

This project provides a detailed analysis and visualization of electric vehicle (EV) sales trends across the United States. By leveraging various data analysis and visualization techniques, we were able to extract meaningful insights into the EV market trends.

## Features

- **Choropleth Map of EVs by State**: Visualizes the distribution of electric vehicles across U.S. states.

## Methodology
1. **Data Understanding**
2. **Data Cleaning**
3. **EDA - Univariate Analysis (Non Visualization)**
4. **EDA - Univariate Analysis (Visualization)**
5. **EDA - Bivariate Analysis (Non Visualization)**
6. **EDA - Bivariate Analysis (Visualization)**
7. **Choropleth Map to display the number of EV vehicles based on location**
8. **Racing Bar Chart to display the animation of EV Make and its count each year**

## Technologies Used

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate and Bivariate)
- **plotly**: For generating the choropleth map.
- **bar_chart_race**: To create racing bar charts.

## Dataset
This dataset provides insights into the distribution of electric vehicles across different states, counties, and cities, and offers detailed information on their range and eligibility for fuel incentives.
